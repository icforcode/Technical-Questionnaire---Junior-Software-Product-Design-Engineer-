Algorithm in Python that displays all prime numbers having 3 digits and starting with 5:

def find_prime_numbers_starting_with_5():
    for num in range(500, 1000):
        if num % 2 != 0:
            for i in range(2, num):
                if (num % i) == 0:
                    break
            else:
                if str(num).startswith("5"):
                    print(num)

find_prime_numbers_starting_with_5()



*The above code is using for loop to check for the prime number in the range of 500 to 1000 and then using 
another for loop to check if the number is divisible by any number or not.

*If the number is not divisible by any number then we check if the number starts with 5 or not. If the number starts with 5 then we print the number.
